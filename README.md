## ***📄 Overview***

This repository documents the coursework and study materials for **INF-245 Computer Architecture and 
Organization.** The course provides a deep dive into the hardware/software interface, focusing on how 
high-level software is translated into hardware execution.

The curriculum is built around the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA), covering the fundamental
principles of processor design, performance optimization, and memory systems.

## ***🛠 Tech Stack & Tools***

* **Architecture:** RISC-V (Reduced Instruction Set Computer).
* **Tools:** Logism, overleaf, RIRS.
* **Language:** RISC-V Assembly.
* **Reference Text:** Computer Organization and Design RISC-V Edition - David A. Patterson & John L. Hennessy.
* **Key Concepts:** ALU Design, Pipeline Registers, Cache Coherence, Branch Prediction
  
## ***📚 Key Competencies & Learning Outcomes***

* **Performance Analysis:** Evaluating computer performance using standard metrics (CPI, Execution Time).
* **Low-Level Logic:** Understanding how software instructions control hardware components.
* **System Optimization:** Analyzing the trade-offs in memory hierarchy design and pipeline depth.
* **Parallel Computing:** Understanding the transition from uniprocessors to multicore systems.
